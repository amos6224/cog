  # of the pipeline request (e.g., the HTTP request --- the output
  # will be the body of the HTTP response).

  # If destinations _are_ provided, but the origin is not one of them
  # (denoted by the reserved target "here"), we add a status-only
  # "here" destination, but only if the request came from a non-chat
  # adapter. We do this because, e.g., HTTP requests need a response
  # of some kind, and we want to indicate whether or not the pipeline
  # succeeded.
